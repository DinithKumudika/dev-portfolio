        description: "Ayumed is a Clinic Management System developed from scratch using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS for the Client side and vanilla PHP for the server side and MySQL as the database. This was the 2nd year Group project of my university. Since university didn't allow use of frameworks (React js, Laravel, Bootstrap etc) we had to build lot of things from ground up including the MVC framework itself the project is built on. Ayumed offered features such as Appointment Scheduling (with email and SMS notifications), Patient Management (including patient records), Doctor Management, Prescription Management, Pharmacy Inventory Management. This was a very simple web application but helped me to understand the basics of web development.",
